The First entry i wrote on this. From humble beginnings and pretentious descriptions.

This is my First Blog post.

Wow. Nice.

First off, you might be wondering what the image has to do with anything. It doesn't. I was just trying to be quick, and a humble photograph of the Cannon Mills market in Bradford,UK was the first one that i saw in my camera roll!

## Statement of Intentions.

I intend on making this space a relatively unspecific catalogue of projects undergone. I had a few ideas of things to try that could be fun to document, and hence have created this space to do exactly that!

Hopefully the overhead in writing a post is not tooooo high, but I have attempted to automate what i can to reduce said overhead! Thank you hugo, and Github Pages.

I did also dabble with using Wordpress for this blog, but the page loadtimes would definitely take a hit with the advantage of ease of use, and the ability to write posts via a mobile device.

## Projects to be documented

I have a few in mind at the moment, with the interest of a passive income source with a high potential for reward being the end goal.

1. Automated/ Semi-automated trading algorithm using MT5's Python interface. 
2. Creating a suite of arcade games guided by ChatGPT.
3. A solution for infrastructure-averse developers to be able to deploy solutions to a cloud provider, giving their soltutions 24/7 uptime and monitoring.
